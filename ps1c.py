'''
To simplify things, assume:

1. Your semiÂ­annual raise is .07 (7%)
2. Your investments have an annual return of 0.04 (4%)  
3. The down payment is 0.25 (25%) of the cost of the house 
4. The cost of the house that you are saving for is $1M.
You are now going to try to find the best rate of savings to achieve a down payment on a $1M house in 
36 months. Since hitting this exactly is a challenge, we simply want your savings to be within $100 of 
the required down payment.
